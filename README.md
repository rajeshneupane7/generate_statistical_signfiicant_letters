# Group Labeling with Tukey Test Results

This repository provides a Python function, `get_letters`, that assigns unique group labels based on the results of a Tukey test. The function processes pairs of groups and assigns labels to indicate which groups are "equal" or "not equal" based on statistical comparisons. This functionality is useful in statistical analysis pipelines where grouped comparison results need to be systematically labeled for further processing.

## Background
In statistical analysis, Tukey's test is often used to determine significant differences between groups in pairwise comparisons. This script helps in identifying and labeling groups that are "equal" based on Tukey test results stored in a pandas DataFrame. It assigns letters to unique group names and ensures that each group is consistently labeled for further data analysis.

## Function Overview
The main function in this repository is `get_letters`, which:
1. Accepts a DataFrame containing results from a Tukey test.
2. Identifies "equal" and "not equal" group pairs based on the `reject` column.
3. Assigns alphabetical labels to groups to signify equality or distinction.
4. Returns a dictionary with unique group names as keys and assigned labels as values.

The function uses `string.ascii_lowercase` to generate labels and ensures that each unique pair of groups is evaluated for equality before assigning labels.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/group-labeling-tukey-test.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies (if any, though this code only requires `pandas`):
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```

## Usage
1. Import the function into your Python script:
    ```python
    from your_script_name import get_letters
    ```
2. Prepare a DataFrame with at least three columns:
   - `group1`: First group name in the pairwise comparison.
   - `group2`: Second group name in the pairwise comparison.
   - `reject`: Boolean column where `True` indicates a significant difference.

3. Call the `get_letters` function with the DataFrame as input:
    ```python
    result = get_letters(df_tukey_speed)
    ```
4. The function returns a dictionary with group names as keys and assigned labels as values.

### DataFrame Example:
Here's an example of the DataFrame format expected by the `get_letters` function:

| group1 | group2 | reject |
|--------|--------|--------|
| A      | B      | True   |
| A      | C      | False  |
| B      | C      | True   |

### Example Script
```python
import pandas as pd

# Example DataFrame
data = {
    'group1': ['A', 'A', 'B'],
    'group2': ['B', 'C', 'C'],
    'reject': [True, False, True]
}
df_tukey_speed = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Import the function
from your_script_name import get_letters

# Get labeled groups
result = get_letters(df_tukey_speed)
print(result)  # Output example: {'A': 'a', 'B': 'b', 'C': 'a'}
```
